woah dude this is git!1!!1

Anyways, seeing the two versions side by side
let me easily see what was wrong with either one
to omou

Having easy access to the entire history of a file could let me quickly
revert back to a previous point if I need to redo something. I guess.

One pro of manual commits is that you can easily look back at history
A con is that dummys may forget to commit :)

Sometimes files independent each other should have different commits

ya see, I use git log to view what each commit was about, find their id
and use git diff to compare the two. duh.

I can experiment more, knowing that it's easy to revert back to a working version

I want to try using Git for Unity projects!1!!
